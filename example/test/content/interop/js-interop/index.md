title: JavaScript interoperability
short-title: JS interop
description: Integrate JavaScript code into your Dart web app.

The [Dart web platform](/overview#web-platform) supports communication with
JavaScript apps and libraries, as well as browser APIs, using `dart:js_interop`.

Web developers can benefit from using external JS libraries in their Dart code,
without having to rewrite anything in Dart.
